### Data Modeling with Postgres 

**Introduction**

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.


**Dataset**

- Song Dataset The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.  The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

- Log Dataset The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

**Project Files**

- ```test.ipynb``` Displays the first few rows of each table to check the database.
- ```create_tables.py``` Drops and creates the tables. Run this file to reset the tables before running ETL scripts.
- ```etl.ipynb``` Reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into tables. This notebook - contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
- ```etl.py``` Reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into tables. This is created out based on the work in the ETL notebook.
- ```sql_queries.py``` Contains all sql queries used for project, and is imported into the last three files above.

**Database**

The database is implemented in Postgresql, i.e. sparkifydb database.

**Fact Table**

songplays Records log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong (songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent)

**Dimension Tables**

- users Users in the app (user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level)
- songs Songs in music database (song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration)
- artists Artists in music database (artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude)
- time Timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units (start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday)
