**Project: Data Warehouse**

**Introduction**

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activities on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

My role is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts the data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

In this project, I load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

**Project Datasets**

The two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

```
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json
```

**Song Dataset**

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

**Log Dataset**

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activities logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

**Schema for Song Play Analysis**

Using the song and event datasets, I created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

**Fact Table**

```
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
```
**Dimension Tables**
```
users - users in the app, includeing user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database, including song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database, including artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units, including start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
```

**Project Files**


- ```create_table.py``` is where I create your fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.

- ```etl.py``` is where I load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.

- ```sql_queries.py``` is where I define you SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.


**Create Table Schemas**

Design schemas for the fact and dimension tables.

- Write a SQL ```CREATE``` statement for each of these tables in ```sql_queries.py```.

- Complete the logic in ```create_tables.py``` to connect to the database and create these tables.

- Write SQL ```DROP``` statements to drop tables in the beginning of ```create_tables.py``` if the tables already exist. This way, you can run ```create_tables.py``` whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.

- Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
Add redshift database and IAM role info to ```dwh.cfg```.

- Test by running ```create_tables.py``` and checking the table schemas in the  redshift database. You can use ```Query Editor``` in the AWS Redshift console for this.

**Build ETL Pipeline**

- Implement the logic in ```etl.py``` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.

- Implement the logic in ```etl.py``` to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.

- Test by running ```etl.py``` after running ```create_tables.py``` and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare results with the reference.

- Delete your redshift cluster when finished.
